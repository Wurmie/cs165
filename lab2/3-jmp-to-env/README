Lab2: jmp-to-env
=================

  Try?
  
    $ SHELLCODE="hi" env
  
  Where do environment variables locate in a process? Could
  you jump there by exploiting a buffer overflow bug?

Starting from jmp-to-env, you will use the shellcode you developed for shellcode32 to read and print out the flag file.

 export SHELLCODE=$(perl -e 'print "\x90"x200')$(cat readflag.bin)
